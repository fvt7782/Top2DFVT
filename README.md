The Mozart Programming System is an open source implementation of Oz 3.
This repository contains the upcoming version 2 of the system.

The status of Mozart 2 is currently _alpha quality_. It is not ready for
production, but it can be used for experimenting, testing, and obviously, for
contributing.
